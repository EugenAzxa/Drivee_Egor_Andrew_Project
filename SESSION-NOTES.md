DRIVEE — SESSION NOTES
======================


SESSION 1 — 19 March 2026
--------------------------

WHAT WAS BUILT

1. index.html created from scratch — the entire app lives in one file as planned.
   This did not exist before this session.

2. Full design system applied — all 14 colour tokens from the PRD set as CSS variables
   at :root. Fonts, spacing, reset, and base styles all in place. Changing one variable
   updates the whole app.

3. 5-tab navigation shell — Dashboard, Services, Hotspots, Legal, Guide tabs all
   switchable. Tab switching uses CSS classes, not inline display styles, so it is safe
   for flex/grid layouts. Nav bar is fixed to the bottom with frosted glass effect and
   correct iPhone safe-area insets.

4. All 5 tabs have placeholder content — every tab has headings, cards, inputs,
   empty states, and placeholder buttons so the app looks real even though nothing is
   wired up yet. Legal tab has 3 hardcoded lawyer cards. Guide tab has all 8 steps,
   3 quick tips, and a working Get Started button.

5. Leaflet map renders in Hotspots tab — loaded via CDN, CartoDB Dark Matter tiles,
   centred on Toronto. Has a try/catch fallback so if the CDN fails the user sees a
   friendly message instead of a broken grey box.

6. ROI Fee Escalation Calculator is fully working — this jumped ahead of the plan
   into Part 2 territory. Live calculation as you type. Exact Toronto fee schedule
   hardcoded: Day 16 plus $15.39, Day 31 plus $32.10, Day 60 plus $32.10.
   Shows fee breakdown rows, timeline bar (green to red), bold red total,
   and green savings callout. Dollar-sign prefix input with no spinner arrows.
   Scroll padding fixed so the output is not hidden behind the nav bar.


ISSUES TO CARRY FORWARD

- Nothing is broken. The foundation is solid.
- Tab icons are plain Unicode symbols. They work but are not as polished as the
  reference app. SVG icons are planned for Part 3 Polish — do not change them yet.
- The Leaflet map renders but has no heatmap layer, bike lane layer, or hydrant layer.
  Those are Part 2 tasks.
- All buttons except the ROI calculator are placeholder only — they show but do nothing.
  That is intentional for Foundation phase.


PRD NOTES

- The ROI calculator (section 3.5 in PRD) is now complete and functional — this is
  ahead of schedule. No conflict with PRD. It matches the fee schedule exactly.
- Everything else built today is Foundation phase only, as planned in Part 1 of the
  build plan.
- PRD specifies React plus Vite plus TypeScript. We are building in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
  per the tutoring rules. This is a known divergence and is intentional.
- PRD may need a note added to reflect that the ROI calculator is done.


LESSON ARC — WHERE WE ARE

Part 1 Foundation: COMPLETE
Part 2 Functionality: NOT STARTED (next sessions)
Part 3 Polish: NOT STARTED
Part 4 Test: NOT STARTED


NEXT SESSION — Part 2 Functionality, starting with Dashboard

Priority order for next session:
1. Profile save — wire up the Name and License Plate inputs to localStorage so they
   persist when the page is reloaded.
2. Fine Reminders system — add a ticket, show status badges (Upcoming / Today / Overdue)
   calculated from the due date, delete button per reminder.
3. Google Calendar export — .ics file download from a reminder card.

These three features are self-contained, beginner-friendly, and do not require any
external APIs. They are the right place to start Part 2.


HOMEWORK SET THIS SESSION

Open index.html in Chrome. Press F12 to open DevTools. Click the phone icon in the
top-left corner of DevTools to turn on device mode. Set the device dropdown to
iPhone 14. Now slowly scroll through all 5 tabs one by one. Write down anything that
looks squished, cut off, too small, or out of place. Bring that list to the next session.

This should take 15 to 20 minutes. If you get stuck finding the device mode button,
search for: Chrome DevTools mobile simulation.


SESSION 2 — 20 March 2026
--------------------------

WHAT WAS BUILT

1. Profile save to localStorage — the Name and License Plate inputs on the Dashboard now
   persist when you reload the page. Used safeGet and safeSet wrappers with try/catch so
   the app never crashes in incognito mode. Profile loads automatically on startup.

2. Fine Reminders system — fully working. You can add a ticket reference number and due
   date, and it appears in a reminder card with a status badge calculated from today's date.
   UPCOMING is green, TODAY is amber, OVERDUE is red. Each card has a delete button.
   Reminders survive page reload because they are saved to localStorage.

3. Dispute Script Builder — select one of four Toronto dispute reasons, click Generate
   Script, and a full formal letter appears in a text area. If a profile is saved, the
   letter auto-fills your name and license plate. A Copy Script button copies the letter
   to the clipboard with a fallback for file:// mode.

4. Street Parking Checker — five Toronto streets hardcoded with hourly rate, enforcement
   hours, free parking windows, and tow-away warnings. A red warning banner appears for
   streets with rush-hour tow zones. The Open Green P button links to the Green P app.

5. Technical foundations laid for safe data handling — parseLocalDate() prevents the
   timezone bug where new Date() would show yesterday in Toronto. esc() sanitises all
   user input before it touches innerHTML to prevent display bugs. Collision-safe IDs
   use timestamp plus random suffix so two reminders added at the same time never clash.


ISSUES TO CARRY FORWARD

- .ics calendar export (Google Calendar) was planned for this session but not built.
  It is still on the list for next session.
- The Copy Script button used inline styles in this session — fixed in Session 3.
- Reminder due dates showed raw ISO format (2026-03-20) — fixed in Session 3.
- Nothing is broken. All five features work correctly on reload.


PRD NOTES

- Profile (section 3.1) is working but uses localStorage not IndexedDB as the PRD specifies.
  This is an intentional tutoring divergence — localStorage is simpler and functionally
  equivalent for this stage.
- Fine Reminders (section 3.4) is complete except .ics export.
- Dispute Script Builder (section 3.9) is complete. The PRD specifies Claude API for letter
  generation — we used hardcoded templates instead. Functionally matches the PRD output.
- Street Parking Checker (section 3.7) is complete with hardcoded data. PRD specifies
  Toronto Open Data API as the source — hardcoded fallback is explicitly listed as acceptable.
- ROI Calculator (section 3.5) was already done in Session 1.


LESSON ARC — WHERE WE ARE

Part 1 Foundation: COMPLETE
Part 2 Functionality: MOSTLY COMPLETE (.ics export outstanding)
Part 3 Polish: COMPLETE (see Session 3)
Part 4 Test: NOT STARTED


HOMEWORK SET THIS SESSION

No new homework was set between sessions 2 and 3 — they ran back to back.


SESSION 3 — 20 March 2026
--------------------------

WHAT WAS BUILT

1. CSS animations — three @keyframes added: slideUp (cards glide in from slightly below),
   pulse (OVERDUE badge breathes in and out every 2 seconds), shake (button trembles when
   validation fails). All three are now used in the app.

2. Card animations and hover states — every card, step card, and lawyer card slides up
   when a tab loads. On desktop, hovering a card lifts it 1px and brightens the border.
   Both effects use @media (hover: hover) so they never get stuck on phone touch screens.
   Tab switching triggers the animation to replay every time you return to a tab.

3. Button polish — blue buttons glow brighter on hover. The Add Reminder button shakes
   when you try to submit an empty form (the same feedback you get from a wrong PIN on a
   lock screen). All hover effects use @media (hover: hover) for touch safety.

4. Badge polish and empty state — the OVERDUE badge pulses continuously. The TODAY badge
   has a faint amber glow. The empty state for reminders now has a dashed border so it
   looks like a placeholder, not a broken layout.

5. SVG nav icons — all five Unicode symbols replaced with clean inline SVG icons.
   House for Dashboard, grid for Services, map pin for Hotspots, scales for Legal,
   three lines for Guide. Active icon turns blue, inactive is grey — same behaviour as before
   but looks correct on every phone.

6. formatDate helper and final HTML fixes — reminder due dates now display as
   Mar 20, 2026 instead of 2026-03-20. The Copy Script button now uses a CSS class
   instead of five inline style attributes. Lawyer fee ranges now use JetBrains Mono font
   to match the PRD typography spec.


ISSUES TO CARRY FORWARD

- Nothing is broken. The verification checklist was handed to the student but not yet
  run through — that is the first task of the next session or the homework for this session.
- .ics calendar export is still outstanding from Part 2.
- The Guide tab first-time auto-show logic (PRD section 3.20) is not yet built.
- Part 4 Test phase has not started.


PRD NOTES

- Polish phase matches PRD section 7 (Design System) component specs: 0.35s toast,
  0.4s card slide-up, 2s danger pulse on OVERDUE badge, scale(0.98) on button press.
- PRD specifies Guide tab shown automatically to first-time users. Not yet implemented.
- PRD specifies lawyer cards pulse for 3s when highlighted by AI verdict. Not yet implemented
  because AI verdict is not built. This is correct — do not add that animation yet.
- Everything built in Polish phase is consistent with the PRD. No conflicts.


LESSON ARC — WHERE WE ARE

Part 1 Foundation: COMPLETE
Part 2 Functionality: MOSTLY COMPLETE (.ics export outstanding)
Part 3 Polish: COMPLETE
Part 4 Test: NOT STARTED


NEXT SESSION — Part 4 Test, plus two small outstanding items

Priority order for next session:
1. Run the verification checklist from the plan — open the app in Chrome DevTools at
   iPhone 14 size and work through all 17 items one by one.
2. Build .ics calendar export — one button per reminder that downloads a .ics file
   openable by Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Outlook.
3. Begin Part 4 Test — mobile layout check on iPhone 14, form validation edge cases,
   empty state checks, and checking that everything survives a page reload.


HOMEWORK SET THIS SESSION

Open index.html in Chrome. Press F12. Click the phone icon (device mode). Set device
to iPhone 14. Go through all 5 tabs slowly and run through this checklist one item at a time:

1. Do cards slide up smoothly when you switch to a tab?
2. Is the active nav icon blue and the others grey?
3. Are the nav icons clean shapes (not blocky symbols)?
4. Add a reminder with a past date — does the badge say OVERDUE and slowly pulse?
5. Does a reminder due date show as Mar 20 2026 (not 2026-03-20)?
6. Try clicking Add Reminder with empty fields — does the button shake?

Write down anything that looks wrong or that does not match what was described above.
Bring that list to the next session.

If you get stuck, search for: Chrome DevTools device mode iPhone.


SESSION 4 — 2 April 2026
--------------------------

WHAT WAS BUILT

1. Complete visual redesign — the entire app was rebuilt from the dark theme (black
   background) to a light premium theme matching the Replit Drivee reference app.
   White card surfaces, light blue-tinted background (#F0F4FF), Poppins font replacing
   the previous system font. All 14 design tokens updated at :root.

2. Font Awesome 6 icons — all SVG nav icons and UI icons switched to Font Awesome 6.5.1
   via CDN. Cleaner and more consistent than the hand-drawn SVGs from Session 3.

3. Full feature parity with GitHub reference app — compared our app against
   https://github.com/EugenAzxa/Drivee-App-Replit-edition and added every missing
   feature including Tesseract.js OCR for ticket scanning, AI chat panel, lawyer cards,
   street parking data, and all Services tab links.

4. Claude AI chat panel — floating panel slides up from bottom with typing indicator,
   suggestion chips, and a CLAUDE_API_KEY variable ready to activate live AI. Offline
   fallback uses keyword matching to answer all common parking questions without an API key.
   Uses claude-sonnet-4-6 model when key is set.

5. Fine Reminders — Google Calendar link + .ics file download added to every reminder
   card. .ics files work natively on iPhone (Apple Calendar) and Android (Google Calendar).
   Browser Notification API integrated — requests permission and fires a notification
   24 hours before and on the due date. Runs a check every 60 minutes via setInterval.

6. 5-slide story-style onboarding animation — shows only to first-time visitors
   (localStorage flag drivee_onboarded). Full swipe support. Progress bar and dots.
   Slide 5 auto-detects iPhone vs Android and shows the correct "Add to Home Screen"
   instructions for each platform. Skip button on every slide. Fades out with scale
   animation after completion.

7. Splash screen — blue gradient (#0A84FF → #0066CC), 2.2s CSS animation, 🚗 icon,
   wordmark, tagline, and loading dots. Hidden at 2.8s so onboarding shows after.

8. New navigation shell — pill-style bottom nav with floating AI FAB button (sparkles
   icon). Top bar with AI search input, bell badge for reminders, and profile button.
   AI search chips: Got a ticket, Free parking, Pay a fine, Dispute it, Car towed,
   Need a lawyer.

9. Government links audited and fixed — Toronto restructured their website and all
   previous links were returning 404. Every link verified and updated to correct 2026
   paths for: pay parking, dispute parking, pay camera fine, dispute camera fine, red
   light, courts, Ontario traffic guide, TPS towed vehicles.

10. CartoDB Voyager tiles — map switched from Dark Matter (dark tiles) to Voyager
    (full colour streets) to match the reference app. Zoom set to 15. No API key needed.

11. Background aurora animation — three large blurred colour orbs (blue, purple, teal)
    float slowly behind all content using CSS @keyframes. Pointer-events none so they
    never block taps. Disabled for prefers-reduced-motion users.


ISSUES TO CARRY FORWARD

- CLAUDE_API_KEY is empty — the chat panel works offline but needs a key for live AI.
  Under needs to paste their Anthropic API key into the CLAUDE_API_KEY variable in the JS.
- The app has not yet been deployed to a live URL for iPhone testing.
  Deployment plan: netlify.com/drop — drag index.html from Windows PC, get URL in 30s.
- Part 4 Test phase has not started.
- .ics export was completed this session (no longer outstanding from Part 2).


PRD NOTES

- AI chat panel (section 3.11 in PRD) is now complete with Claude API integration.
- Fine Reminders (section 3.4) is now fully complete including calendar export and
  browser notifications.
- OCR ticket scanning (Tesseract.js) added — not in original PRD but matches Replit app.
- Onboarding (PRD section 3.20) is complete. First-time auto-show is implemented.
- CartoDB Voyager tiles replace Dark Matter — closer to PRD map spec (readable streets).
- All other PRD sections remain as previously noted.


LESSON ARC — WHERE WE ARE

Part 1 Foundation: COMPLETE
Part 2 Functionality: COMPLETE (including .ics export)
Part 3 Polish: COMPLETE
Part 4 Test: NOT STARTED


NEXT SESSION — Deploy + Part 4 Test

Priority order for next session:
1. Deploy to Netlify Drop — drag index.html from Windows PC to netlify.com/drop,
   get a live URL, open on iPhone for real device testing.
2. Set Claude API key — paste Anthropic key into CLAUDE_API_KEY variable to enable
   live AI responses in the chat panel.
3. Part 4 Test — work through all 5 tabs on real iPhone: layout, tap targets, animations,
   reminder badges, calendar export, onboarding flow, chat panel.


HOMEWORK SET THIS SESSION

Deploy the app using Netlify Drop:
1. On your Windows PC open Chrome and go to netlify.com/drop
2. Find index.html in the DRIVEE folder on your desktop
3. Drag index.html from File Explorer into the Netlify page in Chrome
4. Copy the URL Netlify gives you
5. Open that URL in Safari on your iPhone
6. Test all 5 tabs and write down anything that looks wrong on the real screen

This should take 10 minutes. Bring the live URL and your notes to the next session.


SESSION 5 — 7 April 2026
--------------------------

WHAT WAS BUILT

1. Supabase backend integration — full cloud sync added. Users can sign in with a magic
   link (email only, no password). Profile, reminders, and cars all save to Supabase when
   signed in, with localStorage as the offline fallback layer. Row Level Security (RLS)
   means each user can only see their own data.

2. Profile sheet — tapping the profile button in the top bar opens a slide-up sheet.
   When signed out it shows an email input and Send Magic Link button. When signed in it
   shows avatar initial, name, email, plate, reminder count, and a Sign Out button.
   The sheet uses the same CSS slide-up pattern as the chat panel.

3. Email memory — after a successful sign-in, the email address is saved to localStorage.
   Next time the user opens the app both email input fields (top bar and profile sheet)
   are pre-filled automatically so they never have to type it again.

4. GPS Guardian auto-restart — the browser cannot run GPS in the background, but the app
   now saves a GPS_KEY flag to localStorage when GPS is turned on and removes it when
   turned off. On every app open, if the flag is present, GPS restarts automatically.

5. Multi-vehicle support — users can add multiple cars to their profile, each with an
   emoji, nickname, and licence plate. Cars are stored in a Supabase "cars" table (SQL
   provided to student) and in localStorage offline. Each reminder can be linked to a
   specific car. Cars show as selectable chips in the Add Reminder form.

6. 407 ETR and Quebec payment links added to Services tab — "Pay 407 ETR Bill" button
   links to 407etr.com/en/pay-your-bill and "Pay Quebec Traffic Fine" links to the
   Quebec city constat infraction page.

7. Claude Vision ticket scanning — added to three entry points: Dashboard scan button,
   Legal tab, and AI chat panel. A single scanTicketWithVision() function sends the photo
   to Claude Haiku as base64 and asks it to extract AMOUNT, REF, PLATE, TYPE, DATE, DUE,
   ADVICE. Falls back to Tesseract.js OCR if no API key is set. HEIC iPhone photos are
   handled by forcing media type to image/jpeg.

8. Scan auto-fill — after a successful scan, the app automatically: saves the licence
   plate to the profile (if none saved yet), adds a due-date reminder (if not already
   present), generates a thumbnail (max 300px, JPEG 0.7), and stores the scan in a
   history list visible in the Dashboard. The same logic runs regardless of which entry
   point triggered the scan.

9. Map report form updated — the "Report Issue" form on the Hotspots map now has three
   buttons: "Pin on Map & Email 311" (sends both), "Pin on Map Only" (local only), and
   "Cancel". Report GPS now uses the device's real location via getCurrentPosition(),
   falling back to Toronto centre only if GPS is denied.

10. Street Parking Checker expanded — replaced the 5-item hardcoded dropdown with a live
    text search across 40 Toronto streets. As you type, matching streets appear as
    suggestion chips. Selecting a chip shows the full parking info card. If no streets
    match the query, a "Coming Soon" empty state is shown instead of an error.

11. MapTiler Streets v2 tiles — Leaflet map switched from CartoDB Voyager to MapTiler
    Streets v2 for a cleaner, more detailed base map. Uses API key already embedded.

12. App deployed to drivee.ca — connected to Vercel via GitHub. Every push to main
    auto-deploys. Live URL: drivee.ca.


ISSUES TO CARRY FORWARD

- CLAUDE_API_KEY is still empty — Vision scanning and live AI chat require the student
  to paste their Anthropic API key into the CLAUDE_API_KEY variable in the JS.
- Supabase cars table SQL was provided but must be run by the student in the Supabase
  SQL Editor before multi-vehicle sync works in production.
- Real iPhone testing on the live drivee.ca URL has not been done this session.
- Cars created offline do not retroactively sync to Supabase after sign-in (minor gap,
  acceptable for MVP).


PRD NOTES

- Supabase replaces the IndexedDB spec from the PRD — more suitable for a mobile-first
  single-file app with no build step. Functionally exceeds PRD requirements for sync.
- Multi-vehicle (section not in original PRD) matches the Replit reference app.
- Claude Vision ticket scanning (not in original PRD) matches the Replit reference app.
- All other PRD sections remain as previously noted.


LESSON ARC — WHERE WE ARE

Part 1 Foundation: COMPLETE
Part 2 Functionality: COMPLETE
Part 3 Polish: COMPLETE
Part 4 Test: PARTIALLY DONE (Vercel/GitHub deployment complete, real iPhone testing pending)
Part 5 Backend: COMPLETE (Supabase auth + sync)


NEXT SESSION — API key + real iPhone test

Priority order for next session:
1. Add Claude API key — paste Anthropic key into CLAUDE_API_KEY variable to unlock
   Vision scanning and live AI chat.
2. Real iPhone test on drivee.ca — open in Safari on iPhone, test all 5 tabs, both
   auth flows (sign in, sign out), scan a ticket photo, add a reminder, check map.
3. Fix any bugs found during real-device testing.
4. Run Supabase cars table SQL if not already done.


HOMEWORK SET THIS SESSION

Open drivee.ca on your iPhone in Safari.
Go through this checklist one item at a time:

1. Does the splash screen and onboarding appear on first load?
2. Tap the profile icon — does the sheet slide up?
3. Enter your email and tap Send Magic Link — do you get an email?
4. Tap the link in the email — does the app sign you in?
5. Does your name/plate appear in the profile sheet after sign-in?
6. Add a reminder — does it appear with the correct badge colour?
7. On the Hotspots tab, tap a map marker — does the report form have 3 buttons?
8. On Services, type "Yonge" in the street checker — does info appear?
9. Type a street name that does not exist — does "Coming Soon" appear?

Write down anything that looks wrong. Bring notes to the next session.


SESSION 6 — 8 April 2026
--------------------------

WHAT WAS BUILT

1. Vercel serverless proxy for Claude API — created api/claude.js which acts as a
   secure middleman between the app and Anthropic. The API key is stored as a Vercel
   environment variable (never in the code or GitHub). All three Claude calls in the
   app (Vision scan, OCR enhancement, AI chat) now go through /api/claude instead of
   calling Anthropic directly. This makes live AI work for every user on drivee.ca.

2. Street Parking Checker fix — suggestion chips were not clickable because
   JSON.stringify produces double quotes which broke out of the HTML onclick attribute.
   Fixed by using single-quote escaping. Streets now show info when tapped.

3. Vision scanner expanded to all ticket types and all Canadian provinces — updated
   the Claude prompt to recognise parking, speeding, red light, stop sign, toll (407
   ETR), HOV, distracted driving, seatbelt, stunt, careless, DUI, insurance,
   registration, and camera fines. Added PROVINCE field (all 13 provinces/territories).
   parseVisionReply() updated to extract province. Tested on a real 407 ETR bill.

4. Dashboard full redesign — new layout order:
   - Hero card at the very top (greeting + stats + auth sign-in embedded inside)
   - Bento stats row (Active Fines, Deadlines, Total Saved)
   - AI Scanner and Ticket Analyser merged into one card (was two separate cards)
   - Fine Reminders, My Vehicles, Scan History, Calculator below
   Removed the separate dark scanner-hero card and the separate auth card.
   Violation type dropdown expanded to all 15 types.

5. Pay Now button after scan — after a successful ticket scan, a Pay Now button
   appears immediately in the scanner card linking directly to the correct payment
   portal based on ticket type and province. getPaymentUrl() routes:
   toll to 407etr.com, QC to Quebec city portal, BC to ICBC, AB to Alberta,
   parking to Toronto payment portal, all other Ontario to ontario.ca/pay-ticket.
   If a due date was found, a reminder is auto-set and a confirmation shows.


ISSUES TO CARRY FORWARD

- The AI chat still uses the keyword fallback when no response comes from /api/claude.
  Need to verify on drivee.ca that live chat is working end to end.
- Dashboard redesign needs real iPhone testing — layout may need spacing tweaks on
  small screens.
- Profile card is now below the fold — users may not find it easily. Consider whether
  it needs to move or be merged into the hero card next session.
- Nothing is broken as of the final push. All changes are live on drivee.ca.


PRD NOTES

- getPaymentUrl() extends PRD section 3.3 (AI Ticket Scanner) with direct payment
  links — this is beyond the PRD spec and is a real improvement.
- All Canadian provinces added to scanner — PRD specified Toronto only. This is a
  deliberate expansion that makes the app useful Canada-wide, not just Toronto.
- Dashboard order now matches PRD section 3 intent more closely: scanner first,
  then reminders, then calculator.
- PRD section 3.1 says single plate for MVP — multi-vehicle is already built and
  exceeds this. No conflict, just ahead of spec.


LESSON ARC — WHERE WE ARE

Part 1 Foundation: COMPLETE
Part 2 Functionality: COMPLETE
Part 3 Polish: COMPLETE
Part 4 Test: IN PROGRESS
Part 5 Backend: COMPLETE
Part 6 Launch: IN PROGRESS


SESSION 7 — 13-15 April 2026
------------------------------

WHAT WAS BUILT

This was the largest session to date with 27 commits covering bug fixes, new
features, UX redesign, analytics, and a full security audit.

1. Bug fix sprint (8 issues) — bell button now scrolls to reminders, feedback
   email added to dashboard, nav bar spacing fixed, duplicate FAB removed,
   scroll performance improved with GPU compositing, towed vehicles link fixed,
   map photo popups improved, street checker dead code cleaned up.

2. Full UX audit and fixes — Guide tab made reachable from nav bar, dead See
   All lawyers link fixed, Services search bar made functional with live
   filtering, lawyer firm tap targets increased from 34px to 42px, report flow
   instructions clarified, splash screen reduced from 2.8s to 2.1s, Green P
   link changed to App Store, email validation confirmed working.

3. New features added:
   - Free Parking Now card on Map tab: live calculation from 40-street database
     plus current time, shows which streets are free right now and which are
     free soon. Smart badge shows count, Soon, or Paid Hours.
   - Community reports synced to Supabase with photo uploads to Storage bucket,
     shared across all users. 30-day auto-purge added. Photo library selection
     enabled (not camera-only).
   - Is Parking Free Today banner on Dashboard: shows green banner on Toronto
     statutory holidays, yellow countdown to next holiday on regular days.
     Covers all 11 holidays with correct date calculation including Easter.
     Updated to show holidays only (not Sundays) to avoid confusion.
   - Weekly Did You Know tips: 52 Toronto driving tips that rotate weekly,
     shareable via native share sheet.
   - True Cost Calculator: shows real cost of a ticket including insurance
     impact over 3-6 years, demerit points, and verdict (pay/fight/serious).
     Includes expert contact via SMS and email. Links to ontario.ca for
     demerit point info. Moved to Services tab in declutter.
   - Ticket lookup card in Services: parking, speed camera, and provincial
     HTA lookups linking to official government portals.
   - Dispute Script Builder expanded from 4 to 10 reasons: added not driver,
     outside enforcement hours, disability permit, vehicle sold, emergency,
     active loading.
   - Share/Copy ticket scan details with drivee.ca link and native share.
   - Profile completion prompt on Dashboard that nudges users to add name
     and plate, opens profile sheet, dismissible.
   - Dynamic greeting: Good morning/afternoon/evening based on time of day,
     updates with saved name immediately after profile save.
   - Save Profile button animation: turns green with checkmark for 2 seconds.
   - Calendar integration enhanced: 3 alarms (2 days, 1 day, morning of due
     date), auto-prompt popup after scan to save to calendar.
   - GPS Guardian retry button when location permission is denied.
   - Chat feedback prompt after 3 messages asking users how to improve Drivee.
   - PWA manifest and service worker for installability.

4. Dashboard declutter — reduced from 14 scrollable sections to 7. Profile
   and My Vehicles moved into the profile sheet (tap avatar). True Cost
   Calculator moved to Services. Deadline ROI Calculator removed (redundant
   with True Cost). Scan history collapsed to show last 2 with Show All toggle.
   Support Drivee banner moved to bottom. Desktop side panels added showing
   iPhone/Android install instructions on the left and why Drivee matters
   bullet points on the right (hidden on mobile).

5. Analytics and Telegram notifications — api/track.js serverless function
   saves events to Supabase analytics table and forwards to Telegram bot.
   Tracks: app opens, tab clicks, scans, reminders, profile saves, reports,
   sign-ups, GPS starts, shares, disputes, true cost calculations, expert
   contacts, and user feedback. Vercel environment variables configured.

6. Security hardening — full red team audit identified 12 findings. Fixed all
   Critical and High issues:
   - api/claude.js: locked to 2 allowed models, max 500 tokens, origin check
     restricted to drivee.ca, only safe fields forwarded.
   - api/track.js: rate limited to 30 req/min per IP, event allowlist,
     meta truncated to 200 chars with HTML stripped, removed parse_mode HTML
     from Telegram.
   - Reports table: changed upsert to insert (prevents overwrites), removed
     client-side DELETE (prevents table wipe), removed upsert on photo uploads.
   - PII removed: magic_link_sent and profile_saved no longer send emails or
     names to analytics. Email cleared from localStorage on sign-out.

7. Miscellaneous — fake lawyer discount badges removed, chat branded as
   Powered by Eugen, AI disclaimer added to chat and Legal tab, feedback
   email set to drivee.canada@gmail.com, FAB icon changed to robot.


ISSUES TO CARRY FORWARD

- Telegram notifications now working after Vercel env vars were added and
  redeployed. Confirmed receiving test messages.
- Supabase RLS policies should be verified by running:
  SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd, qual FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';
  This was recommended by the security audit but not yet done.
- The analytics table should have its SELECT policy restricted so anon users
  cannot read all analytics data. Currently only INSERT is needed.
- Session notes file is getting long. Consider archiving older sessions.
- Real users are signing up — first user feedback should drive next session.
- PRD still says dark-mode and React/Vite/TypeScript. The app is light-mode
  vanilla JS. PRD should be updated to reflect reality.


PRD NOTES

- True Cost Calculator extends PRD section 3.3 significantly — insurance
  impact and demerit points were not in the original spec.
- Dashboard declutter reorganisation differs from PRD section 3 layout but
  is an improvement: profile and vehicles now in sheet, not inline.
- Weekly tips, free parking banner, and community report sync are all beyond
  the original PRD scope.
- Analytics/Telegram tracking is new infrastructure not in the PRD.
- Security hardening (API proxy lockdown, rate limiting) is production
  infrastructure not covered by the PRD.
- PRD section 2 still lists Guide tab as Book icon which matches current nav.


NEXT SESSION TASKS

1. Run Supabase RLS verification query and fix any gaps
2. Restrict analytics table SELECT policy to prevent data exposure
3. Collect and act on first real user feedback
4. Update PRD to match current app (light mode, vanilla JS, new features)
5. Test full app flow on real iPhone in Safari


HOMEWORK SET THIS SESSION

Open drivee.ca on your iPhone and go through this checklist:

1. Open the app — did you get a Telegram notification?
2. Tap the profile icon (top right) — do you see Profile and Vehicles inside?
3. Save your name and plate — does the button turn green?
4. Go to Services — type "tow" in the search bar — does it filter?
5. Go to Services — scroll to True Cost Calculator — select Speeding 16-29
   and enter $200 — does it show the insurance breakdown?
6. Go to Map tab — do you see Free Parking Now with real streets?
7. Share the app link (drivee.ca) with 3 friends and ask them to open it
8. Check Telegram after they open it — did you get notifications?

Write down anything that looks wrong. Bring notes to next session.


SESSION 8 — 3 May 2026
------------------------

WHAT WAS BUILT

1. Desktop landing page experiment added — copied the 1770-line Drivee Landing.html
   from the external Drivee wesbite folder into the project as desktop.html. This
   is a marketing-style landing page with intro animation, hero, features, install
   guide, and a top-nav Open the app CTA button. Both internal Drivee App.html
   links inside it were rewired to /?app=1 so the CTA lands on the real app.

2. Smart device-aware redirect added to index.html (lines 6 to 23) — phones detected
   by user agent (iPhone, Android Mobile, iPod, BlackBerry, IEMobile, Opera Mini)
   stay on the real app. Tablets and desktops get redirected to /desktop.html.
   The ?app=1 query param bypasses the redirect, and sessionStorage makes the
   bypass sticky for the whole session so a PC user who clicks Open the app
   stays in the app even on refresh. The block is self-documenting with a
   To REVERSE comment so it can be removed in one delete.

3. Collaborator GitHub repo set up — added a second git remote named collab
   pointing to github.com/EugenAzxa/Drivee_Egor_Andrew_Project.git. Pushed all
   commits and history across. Reset main branch tracking back to origin/main
   so a bare git push still deploys to drivee.ca production as before. To push
   to the shared repo you now run git push collab main explicitly.


ISSUES TO CARRY FORWARD

- Today's changes are committed locally (auto-save commit 942b8c7) but not yet
  pushed to origin, so drivee.ca has not received the desktop landing yet.
- No real device testing done. The redirect logic looks correct but has not
  been verified on a real iPhone, iPad, or laptop visiting drivee.ca.
- Friend Andrew has the new repo URL but is not yet a GitHub collaborator.
  Must invite him via GitHub Settings, Collaborators, Add people before he
  can push code.
- The two repos (origin/Drivee for production, collab/Drivee_Egor_Andrew_Project
  for shared work) will drift apart unless deliberately synced. There is no
  auto-sync. If Andrew pushes to collab and you want his work on drivee.ca,
  you must manually git pull collab main and git push origin main.
- Landing page intro animation runs on every first load. May feel heavy for
  return visitors — consider a session-based skip later.
- Local file:/// testing of the Open the app button will not work because
  /?app=1 is an absolute path. Only works on a real domain.


PRD NOTES

- PRD has zero mentions of desktop, landing, tablet, or redirect. The whole
  spec is mobile-first. Today's desktop landing is a brand-new surface area
  that the PRD does not cover.
- PRD should be updated next session to describe the split: phones get the
  app, tablets and desktops get the landing page that promotes installation.
- The redirect block adds 17 lines of JavaScript at the top of index.html
  before the existing app code. PRD does not need to mention this implementation
  detail but should mention the user-facing behaviour.


NEXT SESSION TASKS

1. Run git push to deploy today's changes to drivee.ca production.
2. Test on a real iPhone Safari — drivee.ca should load the original app
   without ever flashing the landing page.
3. Test on a real iPad or laptop — drivee.ca should redirect to the landing,
   and clicking Open the app should land on the real app and stay there.
4. Invite Andrew as a GitHub collaborator on the new repo.
5. Decide if the landing page text and sections need editing for Drivee
   specifically (some content was generic exploration material).
6. Update PRD with a short section on the desktop landing surface.


HOMEWORK SET THIS SESSION

A 15 to 20 minute task to deploy and verify today's work yourself.

1. Open a terminal in the DRIVEE folder.
2. Run git push.
3. Wait one minute for Vercel to redeploy.
4. On your laptop or PC, open drivee.ca in a fresh browser tab. You should
   see the new landing page with the blue intro animation.
5. Click Open the app at the top right. You should land on the real app
   you have been building all along.
6. Refresh the page. You should still see the app, not the landing.
   This is the sessionStorage bypass working.
7. Now open drivee.ca on your iPhone. You should see the regular app
   immediately — no landing, no flash.
8. If anything looks wrong, make a note of which device, which browser,
   and what you saw. Bring the notes to next session.

If git push asks for credentials and you do not remember them, search
github personal access token vercel deploy and follow the GitHub help
page. If the redirect does not fire on desktop, open browser DevTools,
check the Console tab for errors, and search MDN sessionStorage to
revisit how that storage layer works.
